✅ HIPAA Compliance – Understanding PHI (Protected Health Information) security, privacy, and risk assessments.  
✅ Risk Management – Identifying security threats and implementing best practices for data protection.  
✅ Incident Response – Steps to take in case of a security breach or data leakage.  
✅ Cloud Security Considerations – Applying compliance standards in cloud-based infrastructure.  


🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:
🔍 SIEM (Security Information & Event Management) for threat detection.  
🔐 Encryption & Tokenization for securing sensitive data.  
🛠 Cloud Security Best Practices for compliance in AWS, Azure, and GCP environments.  


📜 Outcome & Impact:
🎓 Participants gained hands-on knowledge of security policies, risk mitigation strategies, and compliance frameworks. They also learned how to apply PCI DSS and HIPAA principles in real-world IT environments.
